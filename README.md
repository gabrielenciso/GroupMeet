# GroupMeet

A full stack web application for groups of people to schedule meetings

This project was built with Node.Js, React, PostgreSQL and Tailwind to get a foundation on full stack web development. I wanted to build 
a web application where I could use web sockets using socket.io to have real time updates as well as implementing a fun functionality like click and 
drag in JavaScript. I also wanted to be able to share my app and have it be used as a tool for other people!
